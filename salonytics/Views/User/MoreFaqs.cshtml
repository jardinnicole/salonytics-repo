Discuss any previous treatments with your stylist to ensure the best results.</li>
                <li><strong>Hair Coloring:</strong> Come with clean, dry hair to help the color adhere better. Avoid washing your hair immediately before the appointment to prevent scalp irritation. Bring photos of the desired color to help the stylist understand your vision.</li>
                <li><strong>Haircut:</strong> Arrive with clean, dry hair or slightly damp hair if you prefer. Bring pictures of hairstyles you like to help guide the stylist. Be ready to discuss your hair care routine and lifestyle to determine the best haircut for you.</li>
